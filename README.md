## Work In Progress

# NeuralNetworks

A repository of files which can be used to implement a Convolutional Neural Network in hardware.



The primary objective of this project is to showcase my understanding of digital hardware design concepts. 

I'll keep updating this README every weekend. Stay tuned!
