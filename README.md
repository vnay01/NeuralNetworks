## Work In Progress

# NeuralNetworks

A repository of files which can be used to implement a Convolutional Neural Network in hardware.

**@6-May:**

Datapath added for Convolution operation. Next step is to control the flow of Input Matrix element in such a way that the convolution stride is 1.

**@19-May:** 

Convolution Part completed.

**P.S.**:The primary objective of this project is to showcase my understanding of digital hardware design concepts. 

**P.S.S**:I'll keep updating this README every weekend. Stay tuned! **Keeping this project on hold as I need to focus more on my Master's Thesis.**
